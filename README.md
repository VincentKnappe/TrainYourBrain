# TrainYourBrain

This is a simple Application to train your brain and improve your basic mathematical skills. The current version of the game only includes addition but I will add more functionality soon.

1. After you started the Application you will see a big Go-Button.

2. As soon as you clicked the Go-Button. The game will start immediately. From now on you have 30s to answer as much questions as possible. 
You can track the timer in the upper left corner of the screen and your score in the upper right corner. The first number in the score frame tells you, how much of your answers are right.
The second one is the total amount of given questions during the game.

3. All buttons will be deactivated as soon as the timer ends and you will be able to start a new game.
